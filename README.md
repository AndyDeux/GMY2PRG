# üéì Second Year Programming Curriculum of the Gymnasium of Mladenovac üöÄ

Welcome to the repository for the Gymnasium Second Year Programming Curriculum! This project features a comprehensive collection of programming exercises and algorithms studied during the second year of high school. Each code example is documented and explained with the help of ChatGPT 4o. Most of the programming problems are from the site [petlja.org](https://petlja.org/sr-Latn-RS/), while projects such as the Final Project were picked from the [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) Dynamic Programming Problems.
